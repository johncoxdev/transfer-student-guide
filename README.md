# Transfer Student Guide

## Introduction
This guide was written for transfer students attending [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/). Written by a transfer student, I'll attempt to answer most of the common questions I see being asked in regards towards UH, or the Computer Science program, degree, and department.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
**1. What is the primary language at UH?** _I'm sorry this one is the longest one._
> UH uses C++ as it's primary language. If you know C++, you don't need to read this, lol. I'm a big advocate about understanding the fundamentals of one language, and if you come from Java, Python, Swift, etc. and you have learned Beginning fundamentals & Data Structures with a language other than C++, then transitioning into C++ will not be hard. The biggest change you may experience is the usage of pointers and references. You can find MANY videos about pointers & references on YouTube. Once you learn them, just start creating a simple project that will use those pointers, references, syntax usages, keywords, and functions that you will be using in C++. IF YOU DONT KNOW THE FUNDAMENTALS OF ONE LANGUAGE! You are then going to need to focus purely on C++. What I mean by this is to start watching videos and doing side projects about begineer fundamentals & Data Structures within C++.

**2. What professors should I take for 'x' class**  
> [CougarCS Discord](https://discord.gg/wEagwaXS7F) has a dedicated channel for class reviews for various professors (Majority of them being CS & math classes). You can also use [CougarGrades.io](https://cougargrades.io/) & [Rate My Professor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/).

**3. I want to meet new people & possibly make new friends**
> JOIN CLUBS/ORGS! This is probably one of the most important things I will tell you for making/meeting friends. You can go on the [GetInvolved website](https://uh.campuslabs.com/engage/organizations) and find all the student organizations currently at UH. _Hint: You should join CougarCS_ ðŸ˜‰

**4.** I'm shy about meeting new people. How can I meet new people when they all know one another already? 
> CougarCS has develop a system of ambassadors! One man and woman have been selected to be the designated person for all new people who prefer to slowly integrate themselves. You can find out the ambassadors are by looking on the [CougarCS Discord](https://discord.gg/wEagwaXS7F) under the Officer's channel.

**5.** How does my GPA work as a transfer student
> UH doesnt take your previous GPA from any other institution into consideration. When you transfer to UH, you have no GPA. You start from the beginning, so with this in mind. Do NOT get D's or C's (if possible) in your classes. Always strive to do your best in your classes, when you notice yourself saying "I'll do this tomorrow" your slacking has already started. Create a schedule and stand by it.
